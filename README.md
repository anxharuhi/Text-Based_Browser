# Text-Based_Browser
Jetbrains academy project about making a small, text-based browser using request, beautifulsoup as well as colorama for a colorized output. Features:

* Basic webpage display capabilities using requests and beautifulsoup
* History functionality implemented using deques
* Simplistic cache functionality using text files
* Nice colored output via colorama. We can't forget to bring a bit of color to our lives after all :)

Depends on requests, beautifulsoup and colorama
